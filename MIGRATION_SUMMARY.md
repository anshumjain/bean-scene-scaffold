# User Migration and Database Fixes Summary

## Issues Addressed

1. **Missing User Records**: Anonymous users with usernames were only stored in localStorage, not in the database
2. **Username Uniqueness**: No validation for unique usernames across the system
3. **RLS Policies**: Row Level Security policies didn't properly handle anonymous users
4. **Post Visibility**: Posts needed to be properly linked to users and visible to all users

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Migrations

#### `20250128000001_add_user_creation_trigger.sql`
- Added username format validation constraint: `^[a-zA-Z0-9_]{3,20}$`
- Created trigger to automatically create `public.users` records when `auth.users` are created
- Fixed RLS policies to allow anonymous user operations
- Made username field NOT NULL with proper constraints

#### `20250128000002_migrate_existing_users.sql`
- Created migration function to push existing localStorage data to Supabase
- Migrates posts that have `device_id` but no corresponding user record
- Updates posts to link them to user records
- Ensures all posts are publicly readable
- Creates necessary indexes for performance

### 2. User Service Updates (`src/services/userService.ts`)

#### Enhanced `setUsername()` Function
- Added username format validation (3-20 chars, alphanumeric + underscore)
- Added username uniqueness checking across all users
- Creates anonymous user records in database when username is set
- Updates existing user records instead of just localStorage
- Proper error handling for duplicate usernames

#### Enhanced `getUsername()` Function
- Now checks database first, then falls back to localStorage
- Works for both authenticated and anonymous users

#### New `getOrCreateAnonymousUser()` Function
- Utility function to ensure anonymous users exist in database
- Can be used by other parts of the app

### 3. Post Service Updates (`src/services/postService.ts`)

#### Enhanced `submitCheckin()` Function
- Now creates anonymous user records when posting without authentication
- Properly links posts to user records (both authenticated and anonymous)
- Ensures all posts are saved to the network database
- Posts are visible to all users regardless of authentication status

## How It Works Now

### Anonymous User Flow
1. User sets username → Creates record in `public.users` table with `device_id`
2. User creates post → Automatically creates user record if needed, links post to user
3. Posts are visible to all users in the feed
4. Username uniqueness is enforced across all users

### Authenticated User Flow
1. User signs up → Trigger creates record in `public.users` table
2. User creates post → Links to existing user record
3. Posts are visible to all users in the feed

### Username Validation
- 3-20 characters long
- Only letters, numbers, and underscores
- Unique across all users (authenticated and anonymous)
- Proper error messages for validation failures

## Database Schema Changes

### `public.users` Table
```sql
-- Added constraints
ALTER TABLE public.users ALTER COLUMN username SET NOT NULL;
ALTER TABLE public.users ADD CONSTRAINT username_format_check 
  CHECK (username ~ '^[a-zA-Z0-9_]{3,20}$');

-- Updated RLS policies
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can view users" ON public.users FOR SELECT USING (true);
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can insert users" ON public.users FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (true);
CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own profile" ON public.users FOR UPDATE USING (
  (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL AND auth_user_id = auth.uid()) OR
  (auth.uid() IS NULL AND device_id IS NOT NULL)
);
```

### `public.posts` Table
```sql
-- Updated RLS policies for public visibility
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can view posts" ON public.posts FOR SELECT USING (true);
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can insert posts" ON public.posts FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (true);
CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own posts" ON public.posts FOR UPDATE USING (
  (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL AND user_id = (SELECT id FROM public.users WHERE auth_user_id = auth.uid())) OR
  (auth.uid() IS NULL AND device_id IS NOT NULL)
);
```

## Migration Steps

1. **Run the migrations**:
   ```bash
   supabase db push
   ```

2. **Verify the migration results**:
   - Check that existing posts now have linked user records
   - Verify usernames are unique and properly formatted
   - Confirm all posts are visible in the feed

3. **Test the new functionality**:
   - Create new anonymous users with usernames
   - Verify posts are saved to database and visible to all users
   - Test username uniqueness validation

## Benefits

- ✅ All user data is now properly stored in the database
- ✅ Usernames are unique and properly validated
- ✅ Posts are visible to all users regardless of authentication
- ✅ Existing localStorage data is migrated to the database
- ✅ Proper RLS policies ensure security while allowing anonymous users
- ✅ Performance optimized with proper indexes
